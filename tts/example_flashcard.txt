ACID rules ensure reliable processing in relational databases. ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability.
Atomicity means transactions are all-or-nothing. Either all operations succeed or none do.
Consistency ensures a transaction brings the database from one valid state to another, maintaining database rules.
Isolation means transactions are executed independently, without interference from others.
Durability ensures that once a transaction is committed, it remains so, even in the event of a system failure.
Together, these principles guarantee reliable, consistent, and error-free database transactions.
